                <h3>About hepatitis</h3>
                <p> Hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Hepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or other body fluids from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. This can happen through sexual contact; sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment; or during pregnancy or delivery. Not all people newly infected with HBV have symptoms, but for those that do, symptoms can include fatigue, poor appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and jaundice. For many people, hepatitis B is a short-term illness. For others, it can become a long-term, chronic infection that can lead to serious, even life-threatening health issues like liver disease or liver cancer. Age plays a role in whether hepatitis B will become chronic. The younger a person is when infected with the hepatitis B virus, the greater the chance of developing chronic infection. About 9 in 10 infants who become infected go on to develop life-long, chronic infection. The risk goes down as a child gets older. About one in three children who get infected before age 6 will develop chronic hepatitis B. By contrast, almost all children 6 years and older and adults infected with the hepatitis B virus recover completely and do not develop chronic infection.

The best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get vaccinated. All adults aged 18-59 should receive the vaccine and any adult who requests it may get the vaccine.   All adults 18 years and older should get screened at least once in their lifetime.</p>

        <h3>what is gender base violence</h3>
        <p> Gender-based violence is violence directed against a person because of that person's gender or violence that affects persons of a particular gender disproportionately.

Violence against women is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in

physical harm,
sexual harm,
psychological,
or economic harm
or suffering to women.
It can include violence against women, domestic violence against women, men or children living in the same domestic unit. Although women and girls are the main victims of GBV, it also causes severe harm to families and communities.


Forms of gender-based violence
Gender-based violence can take various forms:

Physical: it results in injuries, distress and health problems, and may even lead to death in certain cases. Typical forms of physical violence are beating, strangling, pushing, and the use of weapons. In the EU, 31 % of women have experienced one or more acts of physical violence since the age of 15.
Sexual: it includes unconsented sexual acts, attempts to obtain a sexual act, acts to traffic, or acts otherwise directed against a person’s sexuality without the person’s consent. It’s estimated that one in 20 women (5 %) has been raped in EU countries since the age of 15.
Psychological: includes psychologically abusive behaviours, such as controlling, coercion, economic violence and blackmail. 43% of women in the EU have experienced some form of psychological violence by an intimate partner..</p>

        <h3>celebrated world breasting week</h3>
        <p>820,000 infant deaths could be adverted if they are are exclusively breast fed
There is actually a reduced risk of hospitalization for about 72% of  infants who are exclusively breastfed within their first year of life. 
   Despite the  advantages of exclusive breastfeeding , according to UNICEF less than 40% of children the world over are exclusively breastfed. Due to the importance of exclusive breastfeeding, Zion health foundation successfully organized a breastfeeding awareness campaign that got 1000 men and women sensitized on the importance of breastfeeding. The 2023 campaign was under the theme: lets make breastfeeding and work, work! it should be noted that this same campaign was carried out last year during the world breastfeeding week in partnership with the university of Buea midwivery Association (MIDWISA). Looking forward to another exciting session in 2024</p>

         <p style="font-size:20px;" > Zion Health Foundation Hepatitis  Awareness Campaign In Kumba
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">Background and justification:<h1>
Hepatitis, particularly Hepatitis B and C, is a major health concern in the world with  over 1. 5 million new infections.It is worst in Africa, with the highest record of morbidity and mortality. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies conducted between 2000 and 2016, the overall pooled sero-prevalence of hepatitis B virus in Cameroon was estimated to be 11.2% among a total of 105,603 individuals. This means that at least one in every ten persons is infected with Hepatitis B, less than 10% of all who are infected  know they are infected. 
It is spread when a person who is not immunized comes in contact with blood or body fluids from an infected person. 

It is in this background that the Zion Health Foundation conceived a Hepatitis B awareness campaign  since May 2023 (tilted stop hepatitis) , as a first step of an extensive initiative to reverse the current trends and bridge the gaps at the different levels.

<h1 style="font-size:20px;">.Overview:<h1> The Hepatitis B awareness campaign was launched in word of light prayer ministry( a local  church)and extended to public schools, business premises (markets) and parks within the community. The campaign aimed to increase awareness about Hepatitis B, promote prevention measures, engage the community, and offer testing opportunities.

<h1 style="font-size:20px;">.Activities:<h1>
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">-Training of Volunteers:<h1> A total of 30  volunteers were engaged and trained to carry out this campaign. Volunteers were drawn from  Nursing schools in Buea and kumba. These volunteers were also the first beneficiaries of the initiative; all benefited from a free hepatitis B, C, and HIV test.</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">-Sensitization Sessions:<h1> Conducted interactive sessions at churches, kumba main market and traveling  agencies they were all educated on Hepatitis B transmission, symptoms, and prevention methods. Utilized visual aids, brochures, and presentations to deliver key messages effectively. Facilitated discussions to address misconceptions and clarify doubts regarding the disease.
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">-Community Engagement:<h1> Organized outreach programs in public schools to educate students about Hepatitis B through age-appropriate materials and activities. Collaborated with local businesses to disseminate information to employees and customers through posters, flyers, and digital screens. Encouraged community members to participate actively by sharing personal stories, testimonials, and engaging in social media campaigns.
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">-Testing Campaign:<h1> Provided free Hepatitis B testing at designated locations within the community, including the church premises, schools, and participating businesses/ public spaces. Implemented confidential testing procedures to ensure privacy and encourage participation.  Offered counseling services to individuals undergoing testing to address concerns and provide information on follow-up steps.
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">.Outcomes:<h1> Increased Awareness: Raised awareness about Hepatitis B and its risk factors among community members, including students and employees. Disseminated accurate information to dispel myths and misconceptions about the disease.
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">.Community Engagement:<h1> Fostered community involvement and collaboration through active participation in awareness activities and events. Strengthened partnerships with local institutions, including schools and businesses, for future health initiatives.
